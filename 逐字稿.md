# Today,I want to share some imformation about drones to you.

# First,I will tell what is a drone. A drone is an unmanned aircraft. Drones are more formally known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Essentially, a drone is a flying robot that can be remotely controlled or fly autonomously using software-controlled flight plans in its embedded systems, which work with onboard [sensor](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/sensor)s and a global positioning system ([GPS](https://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/definition/Global-Positioning-System)). In the past, UAVs were most often associated with the military. but now,Drones are now also used in a range of civilian roles, 

# search and rescue are the typical ones. For example.in the 2021,zhengzhou,the capital of henan provinceï¼Œwas suffered from flood. Many base stations used for communication were damaged due to the disaster. So that the  communication was cut off. To maintain the essential communication with people in the disaster area, one communication drone was employed.The drone fly to the center of the disaster area and maintained the communication for about eight hours. Though this example, I believe that you must have a general understanding about drones.

# And now I will give you more details about how do drones work?

# Drones have two basic functions: flight mode and navigation.

# To fly, drones must have a power source, such as battery or fuel. They also have rotors, propellers and a frame. The frame of a drone is typically made of a lightweight material to reduce weight and increase velocity.

# Drones require a controller, which lets the operator use remote controls to launch, navigate and land the aircraft. Controllers communicate with the drone using radio waves, such as Wi-Fi and bluetooth.

# Next,lets talk about the components of drones. Drones have a large number of components, such as speed controllers,flight controller,GPS module,battery,antenna,cameras,and sensors.each component has its special functions. For example, Navigation systems, such as GPS, are typically fixed in the nose of a drone. The GPS on a drone communicates its precise location to the controller. An onboard altimeter can communicate altitude information. The altimeter will also help you keep the drone at a specific altitude.

# Nowadays,There are two main types of drone platforms:

1. # rotor drones, including single-rotor and multi-rotor; you can imagine rotor drones as helicopter, which can hover in the air. generally, rotor drones are not so expensive.you can buy one with thousands of yuan. So it's a general choice for drone ameteurs and scientific researchers.

2. # fixed-wing.Fixed wing is a mini version of aircraft, which is often used in military filed. The main advantage of fixed-wing is the flight time. A well-designed fixed-wing can fly in the air for above 5 hours. But a rotor drone can only fly for almost 1 hour. 

# OK, this is my introduction about drones. I hope you can have a general understanding about this filed. It's my pleasure if you really get some useful imformation.
